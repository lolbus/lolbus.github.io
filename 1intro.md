My name is Guang Way<br>
Thank you for visiting my page! <br>
I am interested in the future of data-centric AI / New Techs and making an impact on how they shapes our life. In the last 2 years, I have invested a lot of time to develop myself as a competent ML/DL Practioner. Majority of the roles I applies are related to ML/DL Engineers and Data Scientists who empower AI. I consider myself an innovator, and I am motivated to work on things that were never worked on or succeeded by any others. I believe that work motivation is the key to achieving high-quality deliverables. <br>
Some of my other hobbies include: Swimming, Eating delicious yet very very healthy food and Playing Computer games. Ocassionally, I do solo traveling as well.
