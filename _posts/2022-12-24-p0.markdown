I have completed Course 2 (Convolution Neural Networks in TensorFlow) out of 4 and will be attempting to sign up for the TensorFlow Developer Professional Certification Examination at the end of the course. 
Targeting completion before 07 Jan 2023.
In the first two courses, we learned how to build a very basic Neural network by running a sequel of code using the TF library.
Also went through some data processing (Augmentation and Files processing) as well as some in-built regularization functions within TF.
The course does not elaborate deeply on the theoretical aspect of deep learning. The best takeaway would be I often ended up with a rich variety of useful TF skeleton scripts, familiarized thanks to the coding assignment during the course.<br>
