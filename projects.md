2. NTU, Singapore, Machine Learning & Applications Project, Jan 2022 – Apr 2022  
Title: Kaggle’s Kinship Recognition Challenge: Introduction of Convolution-Free Model to boost conventional ensemble classifier  
(School Final Assignment for Course: AI6102, Machine Learning & Applications. Conduct a research project related to machine learning)  
- Proposed an alternative strategy to optimize ensemble learning final output by combining predictions from CNN variants and Vision Transformer variants, instead of only CNN variants designed to have minimal correlation with each other.  
- Tested the proposed methods on a 2016 Kaggle Competition titled, Northeastern SMILE Lab -Recognizing Faces in the Wild  
- Evaluated performance of the proposed method by evaluating the correlation of outputs from the two models’ variants and the final test score after applying ensemble learning on the outputs of the two kinds of model variants  
- Proven that the Vision Transformer model variants output has a lower correlation to the CNN model variants as compared to the CNN model variants output correlation to other CNN model variants  
- Awarded A+ Grade for Machine Learning & Applications course in NTU MSAI Program  
- Awarded Best Presenter Award (Senior) and SGD300 at STCAI Conference Sharing, 25 June 2022

3. NTU, Singapore, Deep Learning & Applications Project Aug 2021 – Nov 2021  
Title: Reimplementation of “Joint Learning of Character and Word Embeddings”  
(School Final Assignment for Course AI6103, Deep learning & Applications. Assignment Task: Take a conference paper (AAAI, IJCAI, ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, CVPR, ICCV NAACL, ACL, etc ) from 2015. Reimplement the algorithm in that paper. No existing source code is allowed)  
- Reimplementation of paper “Joint Learning of Character and Word Embeddings” algorithm using PyTorch framework successfully  
- In this reimplementation, a new type of ‘Chinese Character’ token ID input was added to the original CBOW word embedding model  
- Training Corpus was prepared by combining multiple free public corpora online based on articles in Wikipedia and Newspaper.  
- Validation and Test performance evaluated based on word relatedness test using Spearman correlation metrics and Analogy Reasoning using % accuracy.  
- Discover that modified CBOW generally outperforms conventional CBOW reimplementation, consistent with the original conference paper. However, the modified CBOW model losses performance superiority with a larger number of vocabularies to total words ratio in the training corpus.  
- Awarded A+ Grade for Deep Learning & Applications course in NTU MSAI Program

4. NTU, Singapore, Engineering Innovation Design, Jan 2016 – May 2016  
Project Title: Design of Supermarket trolley with anti theft system  
(School Assignment for course MA2079, Engineering Innovation Design. Assignment Task: Design and Develop engineering solutions to 
tackle real-life problems creatively)  
- Given assignment objective: Design of supermarket trolley integrated with an anti-theft system, consisting of a GPS tracking device, automated locking mechanism, and sound alarm device  
- Study of existing designs, possible new designs, sketching, and CAD modeling of possible concepts that can be implemented.  
- Fabricate the prototype with the assistance of external vendors, followed by conducting an evaluation study on the performance of the device through experiments  
- Awarded A Grade for the completion of the project

5. Self-Initiated Project – Gaming Bot writer (Part time), Jan 2011 – Dec 2013  
- While studying at Poly, wrote programming codes in Java for MMORPG Runescape game bots to carry out automated instructions repetitively to achieve desired outcomes in the computer game.  
- Utilize gaming bots to intelligently play the game and farm in-game currency by hosting numerous automated bots on virtual private servers to play the Runescape game which was originally meant for real life humans.  
- Overcome game developers automated anti-cheat systems by adding extra redundant human-like behavior into the bot design to avoid detection. (Trial and error from failures when a bot account got banned due to obvious bot behaviors)  
- Take part in online discussions on how to improve bot behavior to escape detection from Game developers or to perform gaming
tasks efficiently.  
- Assist/Troubleshoot other users in the online community trying to write their own code (Learn via teaching)  
- Profited approx. 10,000 SGD by farming and collating in-game currency and then re-sell them to real life users from 2011 to 2013.  
- All botting accounts were completely blasted by Game Developers, following an automated anti-cheat system update in 2017 marking the end of the self-interest research project.

6. Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Singapore – Basic C programming Project Apr 2010 – Dec 2010  
- Trained in the fundamentals of C programming while attending the module “Fundamental of C programming”.  
- Write a simple calculator software as part of the project minimum requirement.  
- Advanced on writing a Blackjack card game software and was awarded A+ for the modular course.  
- Scored A+ for the hand-written coding examination of the modular course.

7. Self-Initiated Project – Maplestory Private Server Owner, June 2009 – Dec 2009  
- Using source code provided by the online community in Java, start-up my own MMORPG game MapleStory private server together with another secondary school classmate.  
- The server was able to gather active gamers and was able to hit peak attendance of about 100 active players from Malaysia and Singapore during the weekend days.  
- Programming of Non-Players characters (NPC) behavior and characteristics to define the goal of the game, the reward system, and negative gaming consequences.  
- Modifying the auto-ban system algorithm to optimize the automation method to identify cheating behaviors of players. (E.g using third party software to achieve an unfair gaming effect)
